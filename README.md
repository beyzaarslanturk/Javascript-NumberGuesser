# Javascript-NumberGuesser ðŸ”¢
<br>

#### This is one of the first projects I've done with Javascript. A random number is determined in the project. User enters number to guess this number. The user has a total of 3 guesses. If the user cannot guess the number, the game is over. This project was completed using HTML and Javascript and my purpose in making this project was to experience basic Javascript features. <br> <br> <br>

My achievements were:
- Master layout creation
- Creating basic HTML attributes
- JavaScript
